# Aurora-Lily58

QMK configuration for my LiLy58, with a few twists :
- French Azerty layout base
- Unicode usage for French specific special characters and more
- Use of combos for some characters (Æ, Œ, A and P)
- heavy usage of layers to minimise numrow usage
- gaming layer
- heavy encoder usage, with modifiers
- RGB goodness
- 14 keys removed, preparing switch to a 3 row keyboard

To-do list :
- tuning the Cirque circle trackpad
- find something better to do with the screens
